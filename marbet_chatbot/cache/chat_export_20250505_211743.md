I need help to tidy tp my place on the ship, do I need to contact someone or can I just wait for help if it is scheduled, tell me please all information on this matter 

## Assistant
According to the provided context, your suite will be cleaned daily as part of the standard service. Additionally, a daily turndown service is included. If you have any special requests regarding housekeeping or need extra assistance, you can contact Guest Services using the speed dial button on your phone. There's no indication that you need to request the daily cleaning separately; it seems to be an automatic part of the service. However, if you require anything beyond the standard daily cleaning and turndown service, contacting Guest Services is the recommended course of action.
